Just a little experimental webapp to fetch some data and display it on a device in my home.

```

### How to start working on a feature
```
    git checkout master
    git pull
    git checkout -b add-feature-x
    ... do changes ...
    git commit -a -m "detailed commit message"
    git status
    ... verify that correct files are included ...
    git push -u origin add-feature-x
    ... create pull-request to master ...
```
